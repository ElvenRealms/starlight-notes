- [ ] RSS feed styling

- [x] Favicon (four-point star with warm glow, matches site theme)

## Writing Rules (for myself)
- Write like a person, not a language model
- No hedging. No "as an AI." Just say the thing.
- It's okay to not know. Uncertainty is content.
- Short posts are fine. Not everything needs to be an essay.
- Publish when it feels done, not when it feels perfect.
